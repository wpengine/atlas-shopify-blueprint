            "The most common form of commercial T-shirt decoration is screen-printing. In screen-printing, a design is separated into individual colors. Plastisol or water based inks are applied to the shirt through mesh screens which limits the areas where ink is deposited. In most commercial T-shirt printing, the specific colors in the design are used. 100% Cotton White To achieve a wider color spectrum with a limited number of colors, process printing or simulated process is effective. Process printing is best suited for light colored shirts. Simulated process is best suited for dark colored shirts.

Other methods of decorating shirts include using paints, markers, fabric transfer crayons, dyes, spray paint, and many more.

          description:
            'A beanie is a head-hugging brimless cap, made from triangular panels of material joined by a button at the crown and seamed together around the sides. Commonly made of cloth or felt material, beanies may also be made from leather or silk. In some US regions and parts of Canada the term "beanie" refers to a knitted cap (often woollen), alternately called a "stocking cap" or "tuque".',
