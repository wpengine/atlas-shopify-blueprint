# Atlas Shopify Blueprint

A Shopify template for Atlas Blueprints.

This repository contains a starter Blueprint to get you up and running quickly on WP Engine's Atlas platform with a simple WordPress site that uses product data from Shopify.

- [Check out the demo store here](https://atlasshopify.wpengine.com)
- [Try a sandbox version of Atlas to get started with this Blueprint](https://wpengine.com/headless-wordpress/)
- [Documentation can be found here](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas-shopify-blueprint/introduction)

## Development

Copy `.env.local.sample` to `.env.local` in your local development environment to set environment variables locally. The sample env file points to the demo Shopify Blueprint Wordpress site, but you can change it to point to a local Wordpress site instead.

[Add your Shopify variables to configure the Shopify Client](#configuring-shopify-locally-and-on-atlas).

Install dependencies with `npm install` - if you run into issues try `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

Make sure that any Wordpress site that is connected to this headless site has its Permalinks set to use this custom structure:

```
/posts/%postname%/
```

## Architecture Decision Records

See the `docs/adr` directory for a list of architectural decision records made so far.

## Tests

Components are tested using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

To run tests `npm run test`

## Linting and pre commit hooks

[Eslint](https://eslint.org/) and Prettier are used for linting and formatting. Please have [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) installed in Vs Code when developing locally to adhere to formatting standards. For pre commit linting and formatting we use [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). This will run when a you run a commit, if it fails check the Node logs for issues that need to be solved before committing again.

## NVM ( Node Version Manager )

`.nvmrc` is specifying that Node.js `v18` should be used. Any developer could then run `nvm use` to download, install, and switch to that version. `nvm install` will then install dependencies in line with that version.

## Configuring Shopify locally and on Atlas

In addition to default environment variables the Shopify Blueprint needs to add 2 more as follows:

- NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_HEADLESS_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_GRAPHQL_URL

For local development these can be added to `.env.local` and for production deployments these can be added in Atlas Dashboard. See [WP Engine headless docs for directions on how to configure Atlas Environment Variables](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/local-app-development/frontend-app-config#2--define-environment-variables).

## Creating a new Github release

The steps involved with creating a new release are as follows :

1. Update the version in `package.json`
2. Run `npm install` and check the new version in the generated `package-lock.json`
3. Create a PR against `develop` with the version update. Review and merge the PR.
4. Create a PR from `develop` into the `main` branch and make sure it includes all the changes that are intended to be in the release. Review and merge the PR.
5. In the User Portal (production), create a new Atlas App using the Shopify Blueprint and verify if changes are there and the version is correct.
6. Create a new release in Github with the tag as the latest version with `main` as the target. (For description you can use the `generate release notes` button)
7. Post a message to [#team-pe-titan-public](https://wpengine.slack.com/archives/C04SJP4UBB7) using the following template:
   > ðŸš€ Atlas Shopify Blueprint - Version X.Y.Z ðŸš€
   > We have released a new version of the blueprint. <Short sentences summarising the changes added>. For more details, follow this link: https://github.com/wpengine/atlas-shopify-blueprint/releases/tag/X.Y.Z
